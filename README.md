# Lab 38 - Sprite Collector

### Instructions

1. Create a player/character sprite.  Pick your own image for the sprite, either from the web or from [kenney.nl](https://kenney.nl).
2. Allow the user to move the player using either the keyboard or mouse.  If you use the mouse make sure you hide the pointer.
3. Display a score that changes.
4. Create "good" sprites.  Pick your own image for the good sprite.
For each good sprite collected, make the score go up.
5. Create "bad" sprites.  Pick your own image for the bad sprite.
For each bad sprite touched, make the score go down.
6. All sprites should be an instance of a class.


**Optional Extension:**
Make an ending to the game.  For example, if the length of the good sprite list is zero, then draw "Game Over" on the screen and stop processing collisions.
